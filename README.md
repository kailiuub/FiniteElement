Objective: this GUI is developed to implement a finite element anaysis (FEA) on the Bar element, including its vibration frequency, kinetic energy and their dependence on the number of elements. 
Python Version: this program is implemented by python 3.5.2. 
Packages: the key package is Scipy which is used to calculate the eigenvalue of the wave equation. Another important package is PyQt5 which is used to implement the layout for accommendating different GUI components. 
Data Processing: the results are shown in the table which can be saved as .csv file by choosing action from menu.
